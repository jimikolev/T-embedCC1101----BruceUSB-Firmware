- üì∂ **Wi-Fi**: Deauth attacks, evil portals, packet sniffing, and more
- ‚å®Ô∏è **BadUSB**: Rubber ducky script execution via USB/Bluetooth
- üî¥ **Infrared**: TV remote control, AC control, and IR signal analysis
- üéµ **Audio**: Text-to-speech, tone generation, and audio recording
- üñ•Ô∏è **Display**: Full-featured menu system with themes
- üíæ **Storage**: MicroSD card support for storing captures and scripts

## Hardware Requirements

- **LilyGO T-Embed CC1101** (ESP32-S3 based device with CC1101 radio)
- **USB-C cable** for programming and power
- **MicroSD card** (optional but recommended for full functionality)

## Installation Instructions

### Method 1: Easy Flash (Windows)

1. **Install Python** if you don't have it:
   - Download from https://python.org
   - Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

2. **Install esptool**:
   ```
   pip install esptool
   ```

3. **Connect your device**:
   - Connect T-Embed CC1101 to your computer via USB-C
   - Note which COM port it uses (usually COM3, but may vary)

4. **Run the flash script**:
   - Double-click `flash_bruce_firmware.bat`
   - Follow the on-screen instructions
   - If your device is on a different COM port, edit the .bat file and change COM3 to your port

### Method 2: Manual Flash (Cross-platform)

Use esptool directly:

```bash
python -m esptool --chip esp32s3 --port COM3 --baud 460800 --before default_reset --after hard_reset write_flash -z --flash_mode dio --flash_freq 80m --flash_size 16MB 0x0 bootloader.bin 0x8000 partitions.bin 0x10000 firmware.bin
```

Replace `COM3` with your device's port (`/dev/ttyUSB0` on Linux, `/dev/cu.usbserial-*` on macOS).

### Method 3: ESP Flash Download Tool (Windows GUI)

1. Download ESP Flash Download Tool from Espressif
2. Select ESP32-S3
3. Load the files at these addresses:
   - `0x0` ‚Üí `bootloader.bin`
   - `0x8000` ‚Üí `partitions.bin` 
   - `0x10000` ‚Üí `firmware.bin`
4. Set SPI Speed: 80MHz, SPI Mode: DIO, Flash Size: 16MB
5. Click START

## First Boot

After flashing:

1. **Restart** your device (press reset button or unplug/replug USB)
2. You should see the **Bruce startup screen**
3. Use the **buttons** on the device to navigate the menu system
4. **Insert a MicroSD card** for full functionality (storing captures, scripts, etc.)

## Usage

- **Navigation**: Use the hardware buttons to navigate menus
- **Serial Console**: Connect at 115200 baud for command-line access
- **Wi-Fi Setup**: Use the Wi-Fi menu to connect to networks
- **File Management**: Use MicroSD card for storing data, scripts, and configurations

### RF Module (CC1101)
- Signal transmission and reception (300-928 MHz)
- Protocol analysis (OOK, ASK, FSK, GFSK, MSK)
- Frequency spectrum analysis
- Jamming capabilities
- Custom signal recording and replay

### RFID/NFC Module
- Multiple card types: Mifare Classic, Ultralight, NTAG, etc.
- Card cloning and emulation

## Troubleshooting

**Device not detected:**
- Check USB cable (data cable, not charge-only)
- Install CH341 or CP210x drivers
- Try different USB port
- Check Device Manager (Windows) or dmesg (Linux)

**Flash fails:**
- Try lower baud rate: change `460800` to `115200`
- Hold BOOT button during flashing
- Try different USB cable or port
- Ensure no other software is using the serial port

**Device boots to blank screen:**
- Press reset button
- Check if MicroSD card is properly inserted
- Try reflashing the firmware

## Building from Source

If you want to build the firmware yourself:
